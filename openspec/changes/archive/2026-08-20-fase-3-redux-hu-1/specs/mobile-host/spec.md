## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Feature folder skeleton is reserved
The mobile host source tree SHALL include a composition root, a shared kernel area, three feature slots (`goals`, `goal-detail`, `notifications`) with public barrels, and a shared UI area for tokens and atoms. The shared kernel MUST contain savings-goal domain types, application ports, and the postMessage contract. The composition root MUST configure application dependencies and a global application store. The host MUST NOT add a navigation stack between features.

#### Scenario: Skeleton exists without domain logic
- **WHEN** a developer opens the mobile source tree after this change
- **THEN** the composition root, kernel, three feature barrels, and shared UI slots exist, the kernel contains savings-goal domain types, ports, and the message contract, the composition root configures dependencies and the application store, and there is no navigation stack between features

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Launch screen is the native goal list
On launch, the host SHALL present the native savings-goal list as the first screen. The launch screen MUST NOT be a full-screen web view.

#### Scenario: List is the first screen
- **WHEN** the Android application finishes launching
- **THEN** the user sees the native goal list and does not see the bundled micro-app as the launch screen

### Requirement: Bundled local web assets remain available
The host SHALL keep the `web` micro-app files bundled as local Android assets under a `web` asset path. This change MUST NOT remove that copy step. The launch screen MUST NOT load those assets.

#### Scenario: Android build still includes web files
- **WHEN** the Android application is built
- **THEN** the files from `web/` are available to the host as bundled local assets under a `web` asset path

#### Scenario: Launch does not load the asset URI
- **WHEN** the application finishes launching
- **THEN** the launch screen does not load `file:///android_asset/web/index.html`

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Host screen loads the local micro-app
**Reason**: HU 1 replaces the Fase 1 full-screen WebView launch screen with the native goal list. The micro-app remains bundled for Fase 4 (detail/abono).
**Migration**: Keep the Gradle/asset copy of `web/`. Fase 4 will load the local `file` URI from the goal-detail feature, not from `App` launch.
